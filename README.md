# fake-news-detection
Fake news has been a biggest concern these days. And with advent of social media, any news let it be fake or real is spreading like a wild fire. So,its important to keep a check on fake news. 
I have used an US-based political news dataset which is available online to train my model.
I used tfidf vectorizer to extract words with high frequency from a document and PassiveAggressive Classifier to classify fake news.
